# Expo Camera Zooming Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with custom zoom controls. After adjusting the zoom level, captured images may be blank, distorted, or show an unexpected scene. The problem appears to be inconsistent across devices and zoom levels.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `expo start`
4. Observe the camera preview.
5. Adjust the zoom level using the slider.
6. Try capturing an image. The captured image might be different from what's in the preview.

## Potential Causes

* Asynchronous operations within the camera's internal state.
* Race conditions between zoom updates and image capture.
* Device-specific camera hardware limitations.

## Solution (if available)

[See `bugSolution.js` for a possible solution.  It may involve delays or specific handling of the `takePictureAsync` function. ]
