The solution involves adding a small delay after adjusting the zoom level before capturing the image, allowing the camera to fully process the zoom change:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';

const CameraScreen = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = React.useState(null);
  const [zoom, setZoom] = React.useState(0);
  const [type, setType] = React.useState(CameraType.back);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  const takePicture = async () => {
    // Add a small delay (adjust as needed)
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    if (cameraRef.current) {
      let photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
      console.log('Photo taken:', photo);
    }
  };

  const cameraRef = React.useRef(null);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; //Loading
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Camera style={styles.camera} type={type} ref={cameraRef} zoom={zoom}>
        {/* Zoom Controls Here */}
      </Camera>
      <Button title="Take Picture" onPress={takePicture} />
    </View>
  );
};

// ... rest of the component
```
The delay provides time for the camera to adjust before capturing the image, leading to a more reliable result. Adjust the delay (100ms in this example) according to your device and specific needs.  Further investigation may be needed if this doesn't resolve the issue completely.
